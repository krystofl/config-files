This folder contains files specific to my MSI Prestige PS42 Modern laptop,
aka "Jeepney".


## Autokey

[AutoKey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey)
is a desktop automation utility for Linux and X11.

To install it, download and install the latest GTK release .deb file from
[here](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/releases/).
Full installation instructions are
[here](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/wiki/Installing).

Then launch the Autokey GUI, and somehow add the scripts from the Autokey
subfolder to it. You may need to make a new folder and copy the file contents,
because Autokey doesn't seem to have a straightforward capability to import
existing folders / scripts.

From there, you can assign hotkeys to each script as desired.
