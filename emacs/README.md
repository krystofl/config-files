# emacs README

# TODO

packages:
- preview Markdown (maybe `gh-md` or `markdown-mode`) - get them to work


python:
- indent and de-indent keyboard shortcuts
- intelligent suggestion (based on class definitions)


editing:
- multiple cursors - see https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/emacs/videos/emacs-rocks-13.ogg
- always indent to two spaces
- go to function definition (specific to each language?)
- show a line at 80 characters


javascript:
- fix indentation issues (see learning-JS repo)
-


harmonize keyboard shortcut to move between windows with Atom?
Atom uses Alt+direction, emacs Shift+direction
